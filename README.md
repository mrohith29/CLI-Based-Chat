Let me give a simple and bref knowledge of what actually is multithreading and sockets are

<dl>
<dt>Multithreading</dt>
<dd>Multithreading is the process of executing multiple threads concurrently within a single process, where each thread shares the same memory space but can execute independently. Multithreading allows for faster execution of tasks by utilizing multiple threads to perform different parts of a task simultaneously, and it ensures safe access to shared data sources.</dd>

<dt>Socket</dt>
<dd>Sockets allow the sharing of data, especially text data, between two processes safely without any data leakage by encoding the data during transmission and decoding it at the receiver side.</dd>

Wll With this basic understanding you should definitely understand the code's functionality and feel free to make changes
